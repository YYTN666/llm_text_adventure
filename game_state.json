  "worldSet": "The world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland ravaged by a zombie virus that emerged from a failed biotech experiment. The virus, known as 'Necro-X,' reanimates the dead and mutates the living, creating a hierarchy of undead and hybrid creatures. The core cosmology is grounded in a twisted version of biological science, where the virus alters DNA and neural pathways, allowing some entities to develop supernatural abilities. The historical timeline is marked by the 'Fall,' the initial outbreak that collapsed governments and civilizations within months. Survivors now live in scattered enclaves, fortified cities, or nomadic tribes. Societal structures are fractured, with power concentrated in the hands of warlords, scientists, and religious cults who claim to understand the virus. Key factions include the 'Purifiers,' a militant group seeking to eradicate all infected; the 'Ascendants,' a cult that worships the virus as a path to evolution; and the 'Remnant,' a coalition of scientists and engineers trying to reverse the outbreak. Cultural logic revolves around survival at all costs, with taboos including reckless experimentation with the virus and betrayal of one's enclave. Technologies are a mix of scavenged pre-Fall tech and crude innovations, while philosophies range from nihilism to fanatical hope in a cure.",
